    <p class="intro"> 
        A complete authoritative book on the life of Prophet Muhammad (S) by Sheikh Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarkpuri. It was
        honored by the World Muslim League as first prize winner book. Whoever wants to know the whole life style of the
        Prophet in detail must read this book. Muhammad (S) is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him, are
        severe against the disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate
        (in prayer), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on
        their faces (fore heads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the
        Taurdt (Torah).
